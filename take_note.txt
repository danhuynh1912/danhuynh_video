* remove a big file wrongly committed in git:
-> git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch path_to_file" HEAD

* refs/original/* is there as a backup, in case you mess up your filter-branch. Believe me, it's a really good idea.
Once you've inspected the results, and you're very confident that you have what you want, you can remove the backed up ref:
-> git update-ref -d refs/original/refs/heads/yourcommit

* shows histories of your commit:
-> gitk --all

*remove file in commit before pushing:
-> git rm --cached -r afolder/
